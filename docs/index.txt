*******************

pymta is a library to build a custom SMTP server in Python. This is useful if 
you want to...

* test mail-sending code against a real SMTP server even in your unit tests.
* build a custom SMTP server with non-standard behavior without reimplementing the whole SMTP protocol.
* have a low-volume SMTP server which can be easily extended using Python.

Installation + Setup
====================

pymta is just a Python library which uses setuptools so it does not require 
a special setup. The only direct dependency is repoze.workflow (0.2dev). Currently
pymta is only tested with Python 2.5 but probably 2.4 works too. The goal is to 
make pymta compatible with Python 2.3-2.6. Python 2.3 may require a custom 
version of asyncore.


Goals of pymta
==============

The main goal of pymta is to provide a basic SMTP server for unit tests. It must
be easy to inject custom behavior (policy checks) for every SMTP command. 
Furthermore the library should come with an extensive set of tests to ensure that
does the right thing(tm).


Development Status
==================

Currently (12/2008, version 0.2) the library only implements basic SMTP with 
very few extensions (e.g. PLAIN authentication). 'Advanced' features which are 
necessary for any decent MTA like TLS and pipelining are not implemented yet. 
Currently pymta is used only in the unit tests for `TurboMail <http://www.python-turbomail.org>`_.
Therefore it should be considered as beta software.


Related Projects
================

There are some other SMTP server implementations in Python available which you 
may want to use if you need a proven implementation right now:

* `Python's smtpd <http://docs.python.org/library/smtpd.html>`_
* `tmda-ofmipd <http://tmda.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/tmda/trunk/tmda/bin/tmda-ofmipd?revision=2194&view=markup>`_
* `Twisted Mail <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedMail>`_

Python's **smtpd** is a module which is included in the standard distribution of 
Python for a long time. In the beginning I used this module for my unit tests 
but quite soon I had to realize that the code is quite old and messy and it is
nearly impossible to implement a custom behavior (e.g. reject certain recipients).
pymta evolved out of smtpd after multiple refactorings based on the idea to use 
a simple finite state machine (repoze.workflow). 

**tmda-ofmipd** is another implementation which is based on Python's smtpd. It is
distributed only as part of a larger Python application which makes it harder 
to use if you just need a plain Python SMTP server. Furthermore the code was not
cleaned up so it may be a bit hard to understand but it supports TLS (using 
`tlslite <http://sourceforge.net/projects/tlslite/>`_).

**Twisted Mail** is probably the most featureful SMTP server implementation 
in Python available right now. It uses the twisted framework which can be either a 
huge advantage or disadvantage, depending on your point of view. When I started 
out with the naïve idea of just extending Python's smtpd a bit, I dismissed 
Twisted Mail because it seemed to be quite hard to implement some custom behavior
without writing too much code.


Architectural Overview
**********************

pytma uses asynchronous programming to handle multiple connections at the same 
time and is based on Python's asyncore. There are two state machines: One for
the SMTP command parsing mode (single-line commands or data) in the 
SMTPCommandParser and another much bigger state machine in the SMTPSession to 
control the correct order of commands sent by the SMTP client.

The main idea of pymta was to make it easy adding custom behavior which is
considered configuration for 'real' SMTP servers like `Exim <http://www.exim.org>`_.
Therefore you should look at the DefaultMTAPolicy to add restrictions on certain SMTP
commands (check recipient addresses, scan the message's content for spam before
accepting it). In order to authenticate SMTP clients (check username and 
password) you may implement the IAuthenticator interface.


Components
***********

pymta consists of several main components (classes) which may be important to 
know.

PythonMTA
=========

The PythonMTA is the main server component which listens on a certain port for 
new connections. There should be only one instance of this object. When a new 
connection is received, the PythonMTA spawns a new SMTPCommand parser which will
handle the complete SMTP session. If a message was submitted successfully, the
new_message_received() method of PythonMTA will be called so the MTA is in charge
of actually doing something with the message.

You can instantiate a new server like that::

    import asyncore
    from pymta import PythonMTA
    
    mta = PythonMTA('localhost', 25)
    try:
        asyncore.loop()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass



**Interface**

.. class:: PythonMTA(local_address, bind_port, [policy_class, [authenticator_class]])
    
    local_address is a string containing either the IP oder the DNS hostname of 
    the interface on which PythonMTA should listen. policy_class and 
    authenticator_class are callables which can be used to add custom behavior. 
    Every new connection gets their own instance of policy_class and 
    authenticator_class so these classes don't have to be thread-safe. If you ommit
    the policy, all syntactically valid SMTP commands are accepted. If there is
    not authenticator specified, authentication will not be available.

.. method:: new_message_received(msg)
    
    This method is called when a new message was submitted successfully. The mta
    is then in charge of delivering the message to the specified recipients. 
    Please not that you must not reject the message anymore at this stage (if 
    there are problems you must generate a non-delivery report aka bounce). Because
    there can be multiple active connections at the same time it is a good idea to
    make the method thread-safe and protect queue access. 


DefaultMTAPolicy
================

The policy is asked after every SMTP command if the command should be accepted 
or not. You can use this to check the parameter of the command or make some 
features only available for selected clients.

All methods in the policy should return a boolean value to express if a command 
should be accepted. If you need more control you can return a tuple containing
the boolean decision and either a single-line response as string or list/tuple
containing the response code and response text::

    def accept_helo(self, helo_string, message):
        # pymta will return the default error message for the given command if 
        # you just return False
        return False
        
        # This will send out a '553 Bad helo string' and the command is 
        # rejected. pymta won't send any additional reply because you did that
        # already.
        return (False, (553, 'Bad helo string'))
        
        # This is basically the same as above but now it will trigger a 
        # multi-line SMTP response:
        # 553-Bad helo string
        # 553 Evil IP
        return (False, (553, ('Bad helo string', 'Evil IP'))

In the default policy you don't have to care if the commands were given in the
correct order (the state machines will take care of that). The only thing is 
that the message object passed into many policy methods does not contain all
data at certain stages (e.g. accept_mail_from can not access the recipients list
because that was not submitted yet).


**Interface**

.. method:: accept_new_connection(peer)
    
    This method is called directly after a new connection is received. The 
    policy can decide if the given peer is allowed to connect to the SMTP 
    server. If it declines, the connection will be closed immediately.

.. method:: accept_helo(helo_string, message)
    
    Decides if the HELO command with the given helo_name should be accepted.

.. method:: accept_ehlo(ehlo_string, message)
    
    Decides if the EHLO command with the given helo_name should be accepted.

.. method:: accept_auth_plain(username, password, message)
    
    Decides if we allow AUTH plain for this client. Please note that username
    and password are not verified before, the authenticator will check them
    after the policy allowed this command.

.. method:: accept_from(sender, message)
    
    Decides if the sender of this message (MAIL FROM) should be accepted.

.. method:: accept_rcpt_to(new_recipient, message)
    
    Decides if recipient of this message (RCPT TO) should be accepted. If a 
    message should be delivered to multiple recipients this method is called
    for every recipient.

.. method:: accept_data(message)
    
    Decides if we allow the client to start a message transfer (the actual 
    message contents will be transferred after this method allowed it).

.. method:: accept_msgdata(message)
    
    This method actually matches no real SMTP command. It is called after a
    message was transferred completely and this is the last check before the
    SMTP server takes the responsibility of transferring it to the recipients.


IAuthenticator
==============

Authenticators check if the user's credentials are actually correct. This may
involve some checking against external subsystems (e.g. a database or a LDAP
directory).

**Interface**

.. method:: authenticate(username, password, peer)
    
    This method is called after the client issued an AUTH PLAIN command and
    must return a boolean value (True/False).


Message
=======

The Message is a data object contains all information about a message sent by 
a client. This includes not only the actual RFC822 message contents but also 
information about the SMTP envelope, the peer and the helo string used. The 
information is filled as the client sends some commands so not all information 
may be available at any time (e.g. the msg_data not available before the client 
actually sent the RFC822 message).

Peer
====

The Peer is another data object which contains the remote host ip address and
the remote port.


SMTPSession
===========

This class actually implements the most complicated part of the SMTP state 
machine and is responsible for calling the policy. If you want to extend the
functionality or need to implement some custom behavior which is beyond what you
can do using Policies, check this class.


Unit Test Helper Classes
========================

The pymta package contains some helper classes which are not needed for normal
operation but may be helpful your unit tests.
