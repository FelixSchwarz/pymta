class IMTAPolicy(object):
    """Policies can change with behavior of an MTA dynamically (e.g. don't allow
    relaying unless the client is located within the trusted company network,
    enable authentication only for some connections). In established MTAs like
    Exim and Postfix it's a very important task for every system administrator
    to configure the message acceptance policies which are normally part of the
    configuration file.

    A policy does not change the SMTP implementation itself (the state machine)
    but can send out custom replies to the client. A policy doesn't have to care
    if the commands were given in the correct order (the state machines will
    take care of that). The only thing is that the message object passed into
    many policy methods does not contain all data at certain stages (e.g.
    accept_mail_from can not access the recipients list because that was not
    submitted yet).

    'IMTAPolicy' provides a very permissive policy (all commands are
    accepted) from which you can derive custom policies. Its methods are usually
    named 'accept_<SMTP command name>'.

    Every method in the 'IMTAPolicy' interface can return either a single
    boolean value (True/False) or a tuple. A boolean value specifies if the
    command should be accepted. The caller is responsible for sending the actual
    default replies.

    Alternatively a policy can choose to return a tuple to have more control
    over the reply sent to the client: (decision, (reply code, reply message)).
    The decision is the boolean known from the last paragraph. The reply code
    is an integer which should a be a valid SMTP code. reply message is either a
    basestring with a custom message or an iterable of basestrings (in case a
    a multi-line reply is sent).

    Last but not least a PolicyDecision can be returned which embodies the
    decision as well as (optionally) a custom reply. The reply has the same
    format as described in the paragraph before. The PolicyDecision can ask the
    server to close the connection unconditionally after or even before sending
    the response to the client (in the latter case no response will be sent).
