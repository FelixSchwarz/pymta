pymta is a library to build a custom SMTP server in Python. This is useful if 
you want to...

* test mail-sending code against a real SMTP server even in your unit tests.
* build a custom SMTP server with non-standard behavior without reimplementing 
  the whole SMTP protocol.
* have a low-volume SMTP server which can be easily extended using Python
